> _Escaping break sessions early will give a penalty!_

### Customizations

Minibreaks' and Breaks' **timeout** and **duration** could be modified

-   Through commands (_Ctrl+Shift+P_): "_IstrainLess: Set ..._"
-   Directly in settings

A few more flags are available in settings:

-   `confirmOnStartup`: Whether IstrainLess asks for confirmation before starting the timer.
-   `allowEscape`: Disable escaping penalty and directly skips the session if attempted.
